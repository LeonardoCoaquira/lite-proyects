This app is used to download videos, audios
and select where to download them

Right now I can't find a solution to install libraries:
ffmepg
youtube_dl
for confortable native use

For this reason, the ffmepg and youtube_dl libraries
must be downloaded separately.

Also while downloading a file it tends to go into a 'Not Responding' state
